    "# Bond and Site Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "``Dribble`` implements a number of different **bond rules** and **site rules** that determine the criteria under which sites bond with each other.  In general, these rules differ from material to material and from application to application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Li conduction in cation-disordered Li transition-metal (TM) oxides with rocksalt structure is known to proceed via so-called **0-TM** diffusion channels [1].  The rocksalt structure consist of two FCC sublattices, one for the cations (Li and TM in this case) and one for the oxygen atoms. Since the oxygen sites are all equivalent, we are again interested in percolation on the FCC lattice as in [example 00](../00-Command-Line-Usage/example00.ipynb).  However, instead of just a nearest-neighbor bond rule, we now have to encode an appropriate rule for 0-TM channels.\n",

    "Alternatively to the above *bond rule* definition of 0-TM channels, we can also think of 0-TM channels as tetrahedral sites that are coordinated at all four faces by Li sites.  The *normal* cation sites in the rocksalt structure are *octahedral* sites, but the Li diffusion takes place via a *tetrahedral* intermediate.  To use such a **site rule** criterion, we require a structure file that also includes the tetrahedral sites (corresponding to the calcium fluorite structure).  Then we can define tetrahedral sites to be only accessible when coordinated by 4 Li sites.  The *sublattice* block for the tetrahedral sublattice looks as follows:\n",
