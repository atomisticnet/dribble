    """
    Parse JSON input file with specs for percolation simulation:

    Main keys:

      structure (str): Path to a POSCAR file with site coordinates
      formula_units (int): Number of formula units in the reference POSCAR
      cutoff (float): Distance cutoff for the neighbor list
      sublattices (dict): Sublattices (see below)
      bonds (list): Allowed bonds between sites of sublattices (see below);
          for example, if percolating channels between sites of sublattice
          "A" and "B" exist, a bond ["A", "B"] has to be defined here
      percolating_species (list): List of chemical species (str) that are
          percolating; this could be "Li" in Li-ion conductors
      static_species (list): List of chemical species (str) that are inactive,
          i.e., that never change during the simulation
      initial_occupancy (dict): Initial occupancies for each sublattice
          as dictionaries; for the example of two sublattices "O" and "T",
          a possible initial occupancy could be:
          {"O": {"Li":0.9, "Vac": 0.1}, "T": {"Vac": 1.0}}
      flip_sequence (list): List of pairs of chemical species ["A", "B"]
          that defines the order in which lattice sites are changed during
          the simulation

    Sublattices:

      Each sublattice has a unique label and is defined by a distionary
      with the following keys:

      description (str): A brief informative description of the sublattice
      sites (list): List of sites (int starting with 1) in the reference
          POSCAR that belong to the sublattice
      stable_neighbor_shells (dict): Site stability criterions in terms of
          coordination shells; for example, for two sublattices "T" and "O",
          and chemical species "Li" and "Vac" the following could be a
          meaningful stability criterion for sublattice "T":

            [
              {"O": [{"min": 3, "species": ["Vac"]}]},
              {"T": [{"max": 1, "species": ["Li"]}]}
            ]

          which expresses the following conditions for the first two
          neighbor shells:
          At least 3 of the "O" sites in the first neighbor shell have to
          be occupied by the "Vac" species.  At most 1 "T" site in the
          second neighbor shell may be occupied by "Li".

          Several alternative sets of conditions can be provided for each
          sublattice, i.e., 'stable_neighbor_shells' is a list of lists.
