"""
Site rules define whether a site can potentially be part of a
percolating network based on the occupancy of the surrounding sites.

Site rules should be implemented by extending the SiteRule class.

Bond rules define whether the bond between two sites is percolating,
which also usually depends on the neighboring sites.

Bond rules should be implemented by extending the BondRule class.
